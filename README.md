# Description
This application creates new workout entries and tracks each one on a graph dashboard.
In this app we have utilized: MongoDB, Node, and Javascript.
I had an issue with getting my seeds to work with Heroku, but was able to fix that with a CLI entry from the website. 

# Installation/ How to use this app
This app is deployed on Heroku and does not require installation. 
If you would like to install it, you can clone the repo, open a terminal and type: ```npm i``
seed the database with ```npm run seed``` or   ```node seeders/seed.js``` Then type ```node .``` to use it on localhost:3000.

# Credits
